Title: Trade-off Between Convergence and Final Performance: Backward Q-Learning Based SARSA (BQSA)

Replication of the Cliff-Walking experiment of Backward Q-learning: The combination of Sarsa algorithm and Q-learning (Wang et al., 2013) (view [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262400193_Backward_Q-learning_The_combination_of_Sarsa_algorithm_and_Q-learning)).

This work was done as a Nazarbayev University undergraduate internship project for CSCI 399: Internship II. Credit is due to Professor Jurn Gyu Park for providing valuable feedback on my approach.
